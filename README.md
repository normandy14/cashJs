# CashJs

This app builds on the success of the previous Github projet, [cashRegister](https://github.com/normandy14/cashRegister) project.
The algorithm remains the same as the original, except a few modifications for converting string information from the DOM back into the number type or javaScript.

## Getting Started

This app can simply be downloaded or clones, then simply open the index.html file.
The app is perfectly usable.
